/*
Abstract factory method pattern is one step above the factory method pattern because factory method can only create objects of one type.
AFM pattern can create families of related or dependent objects.

try to go to (src\main\java\org\example\FactoryPatternApi.java). in that case all the banks related to one type which is bank. That comes under factory method.
in that example, factory can only produce object of one type (bank or animal).

in AFM, the factory can produce diff type of objects.
