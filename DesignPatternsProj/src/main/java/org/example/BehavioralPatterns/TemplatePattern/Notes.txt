A Template Pattern says that "just define the skeleton of a function in an operation, deferring some steps to its subclasses".

Example :

There is an abstract class called writer.
Abstract class for writing to character streams.
The only methods that a subclass must implement are write(char[], int, int), flush(), and close().
Most subclasses, however, will override some of the methods defined here in order to provide higher efficiency, additional functionality, or both.

Since:
